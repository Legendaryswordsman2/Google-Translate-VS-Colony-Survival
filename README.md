# Google-Translate-VS-Colony-Survival

Through the power of google translate every bit of text in Colony Survival has been translated into multiple languages then translated back into English and put back in the game.

The translation language order goes as follows: English to Latin > Chinese (Traditional) > Greek > Korean > Then back to English.

Note: because of modding limitations any client side text such as the pause menu, settings menu, main menu, etc will not be effected, however if you want those included for the full experience simply down the localization file (en-US.json) and override it with the games default localization file.
